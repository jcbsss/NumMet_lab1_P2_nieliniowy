# NumMet_lab1_P2_nieliniowy

Hi! I created this github both for my convinience and to leave a proof of doing programming problems and making progress.

In the series of NumMet I'll upload excercises and projects connected to the subject "Numerical Methods", which I atted in Warsaw University of Technology. These are rather basic problems, but if I enjoy a given topic more I'll try to make a more complex project.

I'm also trying to work out my workflow, using github and other IT tools. I'll try to implement for example TESTING or other features, which for now are undiscovered for me.

I'll try to write only in English, but some materials are given in Polish. I'm not gonna translate everything ;)
